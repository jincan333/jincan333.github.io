I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student, starting in Fall 2024 at [Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/), New Brunswick, under the guidance of Professor [Dimitris N. Metaxas](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dnm/). I hold both a Bachelorâ€™s and a Masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China. Prior to my Ph.D., I spent two years as a Machine Learning Engineer at Meituan Dianping Corporation. My research interests include LLM reasoning/generalization/reliability, Efficient AI, and 3D/image/video/multimodal generation.

**<span style="color:red">I'm looking for research internship opportunities.</span>** You can find my CV [here](/cv/). Please contact me via email if you have any questions.

I'm also open to collaborating on projects. Please contact me via email if you are interested in collaborating.
